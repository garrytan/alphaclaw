# TODOS

## P2 — Runtime guard for Express 4/5 dependency drift
- **What:** Assert `require("express/package.json").version` is major 4 at server boot; refuse to start (loud, actionable error) on drift.
- **Why:** AGENTS.md documents a real production incident: a mutated `/app/node_modules` hoisted `express@5` over the app root, causing silent request-handling regressions (body parsing on certain methods). Today's only guard is test-only (`tests/server/express-runtime-guard.test.js`) — production has no protection.
- **Context:** Add the assertion near the top of `lib/server.js` (before the app is constructed); mirror the expectation in the existing runtime-guard test. Recovery for a tripped guard is the AGENTS.md no-cache rebuild runbook.
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** nothing.

## P3 — Split admin plane from gateway supervisor (process isolation)
- **What:** Separate supervisor process so the admin UI survives supervisor failure and self-updates become zero-downtime (new process takes over the socket).
- **Why:** The availability ceiling of the 2026-08 downtime remediation (see docs/designs and the admin-ui-downtime plan): one process means updates/rollbacks still restart the UI, and a supervisor crash takes the dashboard with it. Cross-model review consensus that this is the correct 12-month architecture.
- **Context:** The remediation's Phase 3 (single shutdown orchestrator in `lib/server/init/server-lifecycle.js`) and Phase 4 (gateway lifecycle single-flight lock in `lib/server/utils/lifecycle-lock.js`) carve the exact seams a split would cut along; the lock is the embryo of the lifecycle state machine. Revisit after the remediation ships and upstream merge cadence is known.
- **Effort:** XL (→L with CC). **Depends on:** downtime remediation landing.

## P3 — Verify sendChatAction deleted-topic semantics; optional opt-in liveness probe
- **What:** On wintermute, call `sendChatAction` with a `message_thread_id` of a deleted forum topic and record whether Telegram returns a distinct thread-not-found error (reports exist of `ok: true` regardless). If it errors distinctly, consider an opt-in, low-frequency background probe for topics that never receive sends (default off — probes show "bot is typing…" to group members).
- **Why:** Lazy stale-marking (shipped) only fires on real send failures; never-posted-to topics stay unverified.
- **Context:** `isMissingTopicError` (lib/server/routes/telegram.js) is the error matcher; the per-topic "verify now" UI button covers on-demand checks regardless of this TODO.
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** telegram-topics-discovery shipping (docs/designs/telegram-topics-discovery.md).

## P3 — Migrate openclaw.json writes to openclaw's config.patch RPC
- **What:** Replace alphaclaw's direct read-modify-write of openclaw.json (syncConfigForTelegram et al — and now the team-mode `gateway.auth`/`gateway.trustedProxies` writes in lib/server/team-auth-transition.js) with openclaw's `config.patch` gateway RPC.
- **Why:** openclaw's writer natively handles JSON5, `${ENV}` refs, `$include`, snapshot-hash conflict detection, and rolling backups — alphaclaw's JSON.parse/writeFileSync cannot. Fail-closed reads (shipped with topics-discovery) prevent wipes but refuse to sync JSON5-flavored configs; config.patch would sync them correctly.
- **Context:** Surfaced by /plan-eng-review outside voice (E2) on the telegram-topics-discovery plan. openclaw's writer: dist io chunk `writeConfigFileLocal`; alphaclaw reader: lib/server/openclaw-config.js.
- **Effort:** M (→S with CC). **Depends on:** telegram-topics-discovery shipping; verify `gateway call config.patch` surface.

## P3 — Size-aware backup retention
- **What:** Add a configurable max-total-bytes retention policy (always keeping >= 1 archive) on top of keep-3, and consider surfacing backup disk usage in the UI.
- **Why:** Keep-3 of ~7 GiB archives is ~21 GiB with no byte budget; small-volume installs can hit ENOSPC (now at least reported honestly, with a pre-backup space warning).
- **Context:** `kOpenclawBackupKeepCount` (lib/server/constants.js:272), `pruneBackups` (lib/server/openclaw-channel-sync.js).
- **Effort:** S-M. **Depends on:** the #7/#9 backup fix landing.

## P2 — Latch shutdown state before the self-update restart drain
- **What:** `restartProcess` (lib/server/alphaclaw-version.js) calls `serverLifecycle.drain()` without setting the lifecycle's `exiting` latch, so a SIGTERM or uncaughtException landing inside the ≤10s drain window starts a second concurrent drain and exits before the successor process is spawned — on an unsupervised VPS that means a self-update ends with nothing running. Route the restart through a lifecycle method (e.g. `prepareForRestart()`) that latches `exiting` and disarms signal re-entry, or move the respawn inside the guarded exit path.
- **Why:** Red-team finding on the downtime-remediation ship review (2026-08-28); bounded window but the failure mode is "permanently down after update".
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** nothing.

## P2 — Make env-save channel sync one atomic lifecycle-lock op
- **What:** `PUT /api/env` runs remove-channels → write env → add-channels as two separately queued lock ops (lib/server/routes/system.js + gateway.js `syncChannelConfig`). A gateway restart queued between them launches with channels removed-but-not-yet-re-added (final config state self-corrects when the add runs, but the running gateway may need another restart to pick it up). Wrap remove+write+add in a single uniquely-keyed lock op (expose a narrow `withGatewayLifecycleLock` from gateway.js or a dedicated `syncChannelConfigForEnvSave`).
- **Why:** Adversarial review M4 on the ship pass (2026-08-28). Rare (requires an operator restart racing an env save) and bounded, but the invariant "env save is atomic against lifecycle ops" held under execSync and silently weakened in the async conversion.
- **Effort:** M (test updates across routes-system + coalescing suites). **Depends on:** nothing.

## P3 — Keep the workspace manifest inside the fingerprint worker
- **What:** Each background snapshot refresh round-trips the full manifest (multi-MB at 15k+ files) through `postMessage`, costing ~7ms serialize + ~15ms deserialize on the main thread per refresh. The worker is persistent — cache the previous manifest worker-side (send it only on the first request) and return only fingerprint/limited/stats (and, with the delta moved worker-side, the computed delta).
- **Why:** Last recurring main-thread stall on the status path (bounded: once per 45s refresh window). Ship-review performance finding, 2026-08-28.
- **Context:** lib/server/doctor/fingerprint-client.js, fingerprint-worker.js, service.js `computeDeltaCached`.
- **Effort:** M. **Depends on:** nothing.

## P3 — Ship-review maintainability follow-ups (2026-08-28, grouped)
- **What:** (1) shared `applyOperationalPragmas(db)` helper for the WAL/NORMAL/busy_timeout block now copy-pasted in db/auth, db/doctor, db/watchdog, db/webhooks; (2) shared cron run-log tail-read helper (block repeated ×3 in cron-service.js); (3) shared `sleep` util (5 private copies); (4) one `kDoctorRepairTimeoutMs` constant for the 10-minute doctor-fix ceiling spelled in server.js and watchdog.js; (5) shared 1s sync-file-lock timeout constant (openclaw-config.js + topic-registry.js); (6) extract the proxy error handler and terminal error middleware from lib/server.js into a module so routes-proxy.test.js stops testing a verbatim copy; (7) `stream.end()` + bounded await-finish as a drain step in log-writer so stream-buffered bytes survive shutdown (in-memory queue already flushes); (8) make system-resources' loop-lag monitor injectable/stoppable for direct tests; (9) surface a `truncatedHistory` flag on cron run-history responses (256KB tail bound); (10) /v1-scoped error handler emitting the OpenAI error envelope for 413/400 parser errors; (11) SWR-cache `getGatewayPort` (sync read+parse per proxied request, sub-ms but unconditional); (12) remaining test gaps: pairings single-flight/500 path, cron-store TTL-reopen/liveness cache, statusPayloadMemo invalidate-vs-in-flight race; (13) `Expect: 100-continue` proxied requests never get the post-header idle-timeout relaxation (http-proxy-3 skips the proxyReq event for them — consider stripping the header on the outgoing leg); (14) `installCrashGuards` removeAllListeners can drop dependency-registered process handlers — remove only known guards by reference; (15) browse preview TOCTOU: read at most limit+1 bytes from an fd instead of stat-then-readFileSync.
- **Why:** All flagged by the /ship specialist review; deferred as churn-vs-risk at ship time, none user-visible today.
- **Effort:** S each. **Depends on:** nothing.

## P2 — Node onboarding under team mode (trusted-proxy)
- **What:** `openclaw node run` authenticates with `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, which trusted-proxy mode rejects; `/api/nodes/connect-info` currently returns an empty token with a logged warning while team mode is on. Provide a working node path (gateway password credential, or a pairing flow) before recommending team mode to node users.
- **Context:** lib/server/gateway-credential.js, lib/server/routes/nodes.js; degradation documented in the team-auth milestone report.
- **Effort:** M. **Depends on:** verifying how `openclaw node run` accepts a password credential (docs/cli in the beta line).

## P3 — Doctor per-run token cost display
- **What:** Show each doctor run's LLM token cost on the Doctor tab by joining usage.db on the run's session key (`agent:main:doctor:<n>`).
- **Why:** Scheduled scans (doctor autoRun) make doctor LLM spend recurring; operators should see what each scan cost before tuning frequency. Deferred from the 8.1 wave's CEO review.
- **Context:** doctor runs use deterministic session keys `agent:main:doctor:<n>`; usage.db already powers the usage views. Wave background in docs/designs/openclaw-context-contract.md.
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** Drift Doctor 8.1 wave landing.

## P3 — Session-kind context breakdown card
- **What:** A Doctor-tab card visualizing the per-session-kind injection matrix (main/subagent/cron/group-channel) from the active context profile — which bootstrap files each session kind actually receives.
- **Why:** Session-scope filtering is invisible today (on beta, subagents see only AGENTS.md; group chats lose MEMORY.md); operators assume every session sees the full workspace context. Deferred from the 8.1 wave's CEO review.
- **Context:** the matrix is data in lib/server/doctor/context-profiles.js; verified facts and citations in docs/designs/openclaw-context-contract.md §2 (session-scope matrix).
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** Drift Doctor 8.1 wave landing.

## P3 — Copy-fix-prompt button on doctor findings
- **What:** A copy-to-clipboard button on each doctor finding card exposing the card's fixPrompt, so operators can paste it into a session of their choosing.
- **Why:** Fixes stay explicit-dispatch by doctrine; a copy affordance gives a manual path without wiring any auto-dispatch. Deferred from the 8.1 wave's CEO review.
- **Context:** cards already carry fixPrompt (doctor service); UI-only change in the Doctor tab.
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** Drift Doctor 8.1 wave landing.

## P3 — SQLite snapshot retention (keep-N)
- **What:** Keep-N retention for the SQLite snapshot repository at `<root>/backups/openclaw-sqlite/` (each `backup sqlite create` adds a new snapshot directory; nothing prunes them).
- **Why:** The verified 8.1 contract makes `--repository` required on create, so snapshots accumulate unboundedly in our managed directory; companion to the size-aware archive retention entry above.
- **Context:** create/verify contract in docs/designs/openclaw-context-contract.md §5 (`backup sqlite` CLI); `kOpenclawSqliteBackupDir` (lib/server/constants.js, added by the wave's backup-runner fix); pattern precedent in `pruneBackups` (lib/server/openclaw-channel-sync.js).
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** the wave's backup sqlite runner fix landing.
