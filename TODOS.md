# TODOS

## P3 — Verify sendChatAction deleted-topic semantics; optional opt-in liveness probe
- **What:** On wintermute, call `sendChatAction` with a `message_thread_id` of a deleted forum topic and record whether Telegram returns a distinct thread-not-found error (reports exist of `ok: true` regardless). If it errors distinctly, consider an opt-in, low-frequency background probe for topics that never receive sends (default off — probes show "bot is typing…" to group members).
- **Why:** Lazy stale-marking (shipped) only fires on real send failures; never-posted-to topics stay unverified.
- **Context:** `isMissingTopicError` (lib/server/routes/telegram.js) is the error matcher; the per-topic "verify now" UI button covers on-demand checks regardless of this TODO.
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** telegram-topics-discovery shipping (docs/designs/telegram-topics-discovery.md).

## P3 — Migrate openclaw.json writes to openclaw's config.patch RPC
- **What:** Replace alphaclaw's direct read-modify-write of openclaw.json (syncConfigForTelegram et al) with openclaw's `config.patch` gateway RPC.
- **Why:** openclaw's writer natively handles JSON5, `${ENV}` refs, `$include`, snapshot-hash conflict detection, and rolling backups — alphaclaw's JSON.parse/writeFileSync cannot. Fail-closed reads (shipped with topics-discovery) prevent wipes but refuse to sync JSON5-flavored configs; config.patch would sync them correctly.
- **Context:** Surfaced by /plan-eng-review outside voice (E2) on the telegram-topics-discovery plan. openclaw's writer: dist io chunk `writeConfigFileLocal`; alphaclaw reader: lib/server/openclaw-config.js.
- **Effort:** M (→S with CC). **Depends on:** telegram-topics-discovery shipping; verify `gateway call config.patch` surface.
