# TODOS

## P2 — Runtime guard for Express 4/5 dependency drift
- **What:** Assert `require("express/package.json").version` is major 4 at server boot; refuse to start (loud, actionable error) on drift.
- **Why:** AGENTS.md documents a real production incident: a mutated `/app/node_modules` hoisted `express@5` over the app root, causing silent request-handling regressions (body parsing on certain methods). Today's only guard is test-only (`tests/server/express-runtime-guard.test.js`) — production has no protection.
- **Context:** Add the assertion near the top of `lib/server.js` (before the app is constructed); mirror the expectation in the existing runtime-guard test. Recovery for a tripped guard is the AGENTS.md no-cache rebuild runbook.
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** nothing.

## P3 — Split admin plane from gateway supervisor (process isolation)
- **What:** Separate supervisor process so the admin UI survives supervisor failure and self-updates become zero-downtime (new process takes over the socket).
- **Why:** The availability ceiling of the 2026-08 downtime remediation (see docs/designs and the admin-ui-downtime plan): one process means updates/rollbacks still restart the UI, and a supervisor crash takes the dashboard with it. Cross-model review consensus that this is the correct 12-month architecture.
- **Context:** The remediation's Phase 3 (single shutdown orchestrator in `lib/server/init/server-lifecycle.js`) and Phase 4 (gateway lifecycle single-flight lock in `lib/server/utils/lifecycle-lock.js`) carve the exact seams a split would cut along; the lock is the embryo of the lifecycle state machine. Revisit after the remediation ships and upstream merge cadence is known.
- **Effort:** XL (→L with CC). **Depends on:** downtime remediation landing.

## P3 — Verify sendChatAction deleted-topic semantics; optional opt-in liveness probe
- **What:** On wintermute, call `sendChatAction` with a `message_thread_id` of a deleted forum topic and record whether Telegram returns a distinct thread-not-found error (reports exist of `ok: true` regardless). If it errors distinctly, consider an opt-in, low-frequency background probe for topics that never receive sends (default off — probes show "bot is typing…" to group members).
- **Why:** Lazy stale-marking (shipped) only fires on real send failures; never-posted-to topics stay unverified.
- **Context:** `isMissingTopicError` (lib/server/routes/telegram.js) is the error matcher; the per-topic "verify now" UI button covers on-demand checks regardless of this TODO.
- **Effort:** S. **Depends on:** telegram-topics-discovery shipping (docs/designs/telegram-topics-discovery.md).

## P3 — Migrate openclaw.json writes to openclaw's config.patch RPC
- **What:** Replace alphaclaw's direct read-modify-write of openclaw.json (syncConfigForTelegram et al) with openclaw's `config.patch` gateway RPC.
- **Why:** openclaw's writer natively handles JSON5, `${ENV}` refs, `$include`, snapshot-hash conflict detection, and rolling backups — alphaclaw's JSON.parse/writeFileSync cannot. Fail-closed reads (shipped with topics-discovery) prevent wipes but refuse to sync JSON5-flavored configs; config.patch would sync them correctly.
- **Context:** Surfaced by /plan-eng-review outside voice (E2) on the telegram-topics-discovery plan. openclaw's writer: dist io chunk `writeConfigFileLocal`; alphaclaw reader: lib/server/openclaw-config.js.
- **Effort:** M (→S with CC). **Depends on:** telegram-topics-discovery shipping; verify `gateway call config.patch` surface.
