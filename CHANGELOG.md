Versions follow this repository's `package.json` release counter.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **One honest gateway status.** The Gateway card now shows a single unified
  state instead of separate (and sometimes contradictory) gateway/watchdog
  rows. The vocabulary, in the order the card resolves it:
  - **Not set up yet** — AlphaClaw hasn't been onboarded.
  - **AlphaClaw starting / Startup failed** — the boot sequence itself.
  - **Status unavailable** — no fresh observation; shows when it was last
    confirmed running instead of guessing.
  - **Configuration error** — OpenClaw rejected its config (exit 78);
    automatic restarts pause until it's fixed.
  - **Down** — not running, nothing in progress; Retry/Repair offered.
  - **Starting** — launching, with elapsed time against the ready budget.
  - **Unstable** — crashed and came back repeatedly; crash count and window
    shown (estimated when the gateway runs outside AlphaClaw's supervision).
  - **Running with issues** — up, but health probes are failing.
  - **Channels paused** — the gateway's crash-loop breaker suppressed channel
    autostart; one-click Resume.
  - **Running** — up, healthy, with real uptime.
  Every state carries a plain-language reason, the recommended action, and a
  glossary explainer. Alerts (Telegram/Discord/Slack/WhatsApp) use the same
  vocabulary, so what pings you matches what the page says.
- **Restarts you can watch.** Restarting the gateway streams live steps
  (checking plugins → stopping → starting → waiting for health check) with
  honest outcomes: success reports measured downtime; failure shows the
  actual error evidence (secrets redacted) with what to try next — no more
  "Gateway restarted ✅" over a dead gateway. Restarts survive page reloads
  and even an AlphaClaw crash mid-restart ("interrupted restart" on reboot).
- **Faster dead-gateway detection.** An always-on 10-second port watcher plus
  immediate re-checks after every restart/repair replace the old
  up-to-2-minutes wait; stale verdicts like a lingering "crash loop" clear
  the moment reality changes.
- **Send test notification** button and last-delivered timestamp, so you can
  verify alerting before you need it.

### Changed
- **Nearly everything is faster.** The server no longer freezes itself:
  status checks, restarts, and boots run off the event loop; the
  logs/watchdog page queries are indexed; the Upgrade page catalog serves
  instantly from cache while refreshing in the background; responses are
  compressed; charts load on demand. Status responses that took seconds
  under load now answer in milliseconds.
- **Expected restart during upgrades:** a gateway restart is part of channel
  switches and upgrades; the watchdog now knows the restart window is
  expected and won't report it as a crash or trigger rollback hooks during
  it.
- **API compatibility window:** `/api/status` keeps the legacy
  `gateway`/`watchdogStatus` fields for one minor release as projections of
  the new `state` object (they can no longer disagree). `POST
  /api/gateway/restart` keeps blocking semantics by default; new clients
  opt into `?async=1` + the streamed operation. Both defaults flip next
  minor.
- **Rollback implications:** automatic version rollback still arms after
  gateway restarts; interrupted or failed restarts leave the rollback
  window and its incident reporting exactly as before — with clearer
  attribution in the incident feed ("automatic repair" vs manual restart).

## [0.9.34] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- **OpenClaw release channels (stable / beta / dev).** Pick a channel and a
  version from a new **Upgrade** page and switch with one click — including
  building OpenClaw's `main` branch from source the same way its dev channel
  does. Restarts deterministically re-apply your selection offline; nothing
  updates unless you ask.
- **Upgrade page** with the running version and what's in it, the last 5
  stable and beta releases plus recent dev commits, release notes, live
  streamed build progress with automatic reconnect after the restart, and a
  guided channel-switch flow.
- **Automatic rollback.** A new version that crash-loops, exits with a config
  error, or stays degraded in its first 24 hours is blocklisted and rolled
  back to your last known good version (or the built-in pin) — with an
  incident card explaining what happened and a "Mark as good now" escape
  hatch that disarms the window.
- **Safety rails around switching:** verified backup before every switch
  (downgrades and dev builds are blocked if the backup fails), disk/toolchain/
  Node-compatibility preflights, verification of every downloaded or built
  artifact before it can activate, and a locally persisted pin snapshot so
  rollback always has an offline target.
- **Live end-to-end test tiers** (`npm run test:live`, `test:live:dev`) that
  exercise the real npm registry, the real GitHub API, and a real from-source
  OpenClaw build — scheduled in CI to catch upstream drift.

### Changed
- The gateway now runs with `OPENCLAW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`; version changes go
  through the Upgrade page only, and out-of-band changes are detected and
  reverted at the next restart.
- Version activation happens only at boot from a local overlay store, so a
  half-finished download or build can never replace the running install.
- Candidate downloads, build scripts, and verification probes run with an
  isolated HOME and a secret-free environment.

### Fixed
- Version comparisons now rank hotfix suffixes (`2026.7.1-2`) above their
  base release and prereleases (`-beta.N`) below it, consistently across the
  server and the UI.
- An update interrupted by a restart is closed out at the next boot instead
  of leaving the Upgrade page permanently locked on a phantom operation.
- A routine AlphaClaw self-update no longer triggers the "OpenClaw was
  changed outside this dashboard" warning while npm catches up to the new
  pinned version.

### Removed
- Stale `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pinned an old OpenClaw; CI and installs are
  npm-only).

## [0.9.33] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Cron message delivery no longer logs a spurious warning.

## [0.9.32] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Cron jobs are restored from OpenClaw's SQLite store after a restart.

### Changed
- Test coverage raised from 71% to 99.6% of lines (2,077 tests).

## [0.9.31] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- OpenClaw pinned to 2026.7.1-2 (hotfix) and the watchdog hardened for the
  OpenClaw 2026.7.1 gateway lifecycle contract.

### Fixed
- Webhook mappings created before OpenClaw 7.1 get IDs backfilled so they
  keep working after the upgrade.

## [0.9.30] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- OpenClaw 2026.7.1 support and GPT-5.6 model support.

### Fixed
- Onboarding writes `ALPHACLAW_ROOT_DIR` into the generated system cron file.
