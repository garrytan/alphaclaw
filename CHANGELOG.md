## [0.9.34] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- **OpenClaw release channels (stable / beta / dev).** Pick a channel and a
  version from a new **Upgrade** page and switch with one click — including
  building OpenClaw's `main` branch from source the same way its dev channel
  does. Restarts deterministically re-apply your selection offline; nothing
  updates unless you ask.
- **Upgrade page** with the running version and what's in it, the last 5
  stable and beta releases plus recent dev commits, release notes, live
  streamed build progress with automatic reconnect after the restart, and a
  guided channel-switch flow.
- **Automatic rollback.** A new version that crash-loops, exits with a config
  error, or stays degraded in its first 24 hours is blocklisted and rolled
  back to your last known good version (or the built-in pin) — with an
  incident card explaining what happened and a "Mark as good now" escape
  hatch that disarms the window.
- **Safety rails around switching:** verified backup before every switch
  (downgrades and dev builds are blocked if the backup fails), disk/toolchain/
  Node-compatibility preflights, verification of every downloaded or built
  artifact before it can activate, and a locally persisted pin snapshot so
  rollback always has an offline target.
- **Live end-to-end test tiers** (`npm run test:live`, `test:live:dev`) that
  exercise the real npm registry, the real GitHub API, and a real from-source
  OpenClaw build — scheduled in CI to catch upstream drift.

### Changed
- The gateway now runs with `OPENCLAW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`; version changes go
  through the Upgrade page only, and out-of-band changes are detected and
  reverted at the next restart.
- Version activation happens only at boot from a local overlay store, so a
  half-finished download or build can never replace the running install.
- Candidate downloads, build scripts, and verification probes run with an
  isolated HOME and a secret-free environment.

### Fixed
- Version comparisons now rank hotfix suffixes (`2026.7.1-2`) above their
  base release and prereleases (`-beta.N`) below it, consistently across the
  server and the UI.
- An update interrupted by a restart is closed out at the next boot instead
  of leaving the Upgrade page permanently locked on a phantom operation.
- A routine AlphaClaw self-update no longer triggers the "OpenClaw was
  changed outside this dashboard" warning while npm catches up to the new
  pinned version.

### Removed
- Stale `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pinned an old OpenClaw; CI and installs are
  npm-only).

## [0.9.33] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Cron message delivery no longer logs a spurious warning.

## [0.9.32] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Cron jobs are restored from OpenClaw's SQLite store after a restart.

### Changed
- Test coverage raised from 71% to 99.6% of lines (2,077 tests).

## [0.9.31] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- OpenClaw pinned to 2026.7.1-2 (hotfix) and the watchdog hardened for the
  OpenClaw 2026.7.1 gateway lifecycle contract.

### Fixed
- Webhook mappings created before OpenClaw 7.1 get IDs backfilled so they
  keep working after the upgrade.

## [0.9.30] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- OpenClaw 2026.7.1 support and GPT-5.6 model support.

### Fixed
- Onboarding writes `ALPHACLAW_ROOT_DIR` into the generated system cron file.
